# Building from sources

Building the C and C# libraries of MixedReality-WebRTC from sources involves two main steps:

1. Building the native C library for the specific platform(s) of interest:
   - [Bulding for Windows platforms (Desktop and UWP)](building-windows.md)
   - [Bulding for Android (Unity)](android/building-android.md)
2. [Building the platform-independent C# library](building-cslib.md).

On Windows, if you want to start right away with MixedReality-WebRTC, the recommended approach is to consume the precompiled binaries distributed as NuGet packages instead. See [Download](download.md) for details. There is currently no prebuilt Android binaries.
