> FIXME: This component is not currently functional. The remote audio data is currently sent directly to the local device audio output (speakers) by the internal WebRTC implementation without any configuration possible. See issue [#92](https://github.com/microsoft/MixedReality-WebRTC/issues/92) for details.
